        <h2>Game Development Synopsis</h2>
        <p>

            Of course! Here's a revised version that maintains your original style, focusing on fixing typos and
            improving sentence structure without altering the casual tone.

            Revised Synopsis:
            Developed for my IT265 class, this small game demonstrates various topics and the process of iterative
            development. It's a top-down "dungeon crawler" where players use click-to-move and click-to-interact
            mechanics to navigate through procedurally generated dungeons. Each dungeon room contains 2-5 chests: one
            always holds a key to the next room, while others may be empty, contain a random reward, a trap, or an
            enemy. The aim is to survive each level without losing all of the character's life, with each successful
            level leading to a new, procedurally generated challenge, allowing for an infinite gameplay experience.
            Players have access to a couple of base abilities to help them survive: a "Sap" ability to stun or disable
            dangerous chests and a lockpicking ability to open locked chests through a mini-game. Both abilities have
            limited uses but can be replenished from reward chests. </p>

                        This version introduces the core concepts: click-based movement and interaction, procedural
                        dungeon generation, and the various types of chests. It serves as the basic prototype for the

                        In this version, the game's atmosphere is enhanced with limited light. The primary light source
                        follows the player but gradually fades over time. A new chest reward can extend the light
                        duration. Corridors between rooms now feature random torches for aesthetic improvement.
                        Additionally, various sound effects and particle effects were introduced to enrich the design,
                        style, and theme. A new ability was added, allowing players to scan chests within a radius,
                        making them glow faintly in low light conditions. Chests glow different colors to indicate their
                        contents: yellow for a key, red for a trap, white for empty, orange for a light source
                        extension, purple for an enemy (mimic), and green for a reward. Some UI elements were refined,
                        including a "give up" button for levels that can't be completed and an event log showing player
                        actions like opening chests and doors. <a href="https://matttoegel.github.io/PickyPocket/v1">Try this version</a></div>

                        generated for each level within a certain range. Additionally, a gold bag UI element was added
                        to display the player's current gold amount. <a href="https://matttoegel.github.io/PickyPocket/v2">Try this version</a></div>
